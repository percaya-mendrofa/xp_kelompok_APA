## 🎯 XP Practices Documentation

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Red**: Write failing tests first
- **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass
- **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

Example TDD cycle for task creation:
\`\`\`typescript
// 1. RED: Write failing test
it('should create a new task with generated id', () => {
  const taskData = { title: 'Test', description: 'Test desc', priority: 'high', status: 'to-do' }
  const task = TaskService.createTask(taskData)
  expect(task.id).toBeDefined()
})

// 2. GREEN: Implement minimal code
static createTask(taskData: TaskFormData): Task {
  return { id: Date.now(), ...taskData, createdAt: new Date().toISOString(), updatedAt: new Date().toISOString() }
}

// 3. REFACTOR: Improve implementation
\`\`\`

### 2. Continuous Integration
- Automated testing on every commit
- Build verification before deployment
- Code quality checks with ESLint

### 3. Small Releases
- Feature-based development
- Daily deployments
- Incremental improvements

### 4. Refactoring
- Modular component architecture
- Separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data)
- Clean, readable code
